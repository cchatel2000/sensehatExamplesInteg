# sensehatExamplesInteg
Integration of some examples concerning RPI sensehat for portable use with battery power and 
without external items (mouse, keyboard and so on). Joystick helps move between examples.
To run these examples, you just need to 
copy all files in a /home/pi/sensehat directory, 
copy sensehat.sh in /home/pi and 
add @/home/pi/sensehat.sh to /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart. 

Next time you restart the PI you have all these examples in hand just moving the white dot whis the joystick and 
pushing the rod to select the entry.

Enjoys!
